# Carbonified

Carbonified is a platform that focuses on climate consciousness. The platform allows users to make estimates of carbon emissions based on a specific situation, device or automobile machine. The estimates are calculated using the API provided by [Carbon Interface](https://docs.carboninterface.com/#/?id=introduction)

## Minimum Viable Product
The following requirements must be delivered in order to consider the submission as complete:

- Home Page: When a user first opens the application, they should be greeted with a page that has information about what the application aims to do.
- Listing of estimates: Users should be able to choose from a list of estimates to calculate.
- Estimate data: Users should be able to use the estimates API provided to get actual estimate data.
- User Interface: Users should be able to interact with cool CSS animations on the User interface.
- Data Visualization: Estimates should be stored in a table for later analysis. A graph should be provided to view the trend of estimates e.g electricity.

# Carbonified

Carbonified is a platform that focuses on climate consciousness. The platform allows users to make estimates of carbon emissions based on a specific situation, device or automobile machine. The estimates are calculated using the API provided by [Carbon Interface](https://docs.carboninterface.com/#/?id=introduction)
